1. empty(): this is bool function, if the list is empty it returns true otherwise, it returns false.
2. insertbegin(): this is void function, it adds an item in the beginning of the list.
3. insertbeforeitem(): this is void function, it adds an item befor an item that you want.
4. append(): this is void function, it adds an item at the end of the list.
